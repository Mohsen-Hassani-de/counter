## Description

The counter project is a minimalistic implementation consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It offers a simple interface with buttons to increment, decrement, and reset the counter value.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. The counter is displayed in the center of the page, with an initial value of 0.

3. Use the three buttons below the counter to perform operations:
   - **Increment:** Increases the counter value by 1.
   - **Decrement:** Decreases the counter value by 1.
   - **Reset:** Resets the counter value to 0.

4. The counter value is dynamically updated on the page as you perform operations.

## Styling

The counter project is intentionally designed for ease of understanding. The styling is kept minimal to focus on the core functionality. The color scheme and button styling provide a clear and intuitive user interface.
